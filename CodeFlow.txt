BANKING SYSTEM - CODE FLOW EXPLANATION
========================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
This is a simple banking system program that allows users to:
1. Create new bank accounts
2. Deposit money into accounts
3. Withdraw money from accounts
4. Check account balance

The program can handle up to 8 accounts at a time.

========================================
DATA STRUCTURES (Global Variables)
========================================

1. accno[8]        - Stores account numbers (long int array)
2. accname[8][20]  - Stores account holder names (2D character array)
3. balance[8]      - Stores account balances (long int array)
4. pincode[8]      - Stores PIN codes for each account (long int array)
5. accountCount    - Tracks how many accounts have been created (int)

These are global variables, meaning they can be accessed from any function.

FUNCTIONS EXPLANATION
========================================

1. createaccount()
   ----------------
   Purpose: Creates a new bank account
   
   Flow:
   1. Check if maximum accounts (8) reached
   2. Get current index (accountCount)
   3. Ask user for:
      - Account Number
      - Account Holder Name
      - Initial Amount
      - 4-digit PIN
   4. Store all information in arrays at current index
   5. Display confirmation message
   6. Increment accountCount

2. findAccount(long int accountNum)
   ---------------------------------
   Purpose: Searches for an account by account number
   
   Flow:
   1. Loop through all existing accounts (0 to accountCount-1)
   2. Compare each accno[i] with the given accountNum
   3. If found, return the index (i)
   4. If not found after checking all, return -1

3. verifyPIN(int index, long int pin)
   -----------------------------------
   Purpose: Verifies if the entered PIN matches the account's PIN
   
   Flow:
   1. Compare pincode[index] with the entered pin
   2. Return 1 if match, 0 if no match

4. deposit()
   ----------
   Purpose: Adds money to an account
   
   Flow:
   1. Ask user for account number
   2. Call findAccount() to locate the account
   3. If account not found, show error and return
   4. Ask user for amount to deposit
   5. If amount is positive, add it to balance[index]
   6. Display new balance

5. withdraw()
   -----------
   Purpose: Removes money from an account
   
   Flow:
   1. Ask user for account number
   2. Call findAccount() to locate the account
   3. If account not found, show error and return
   4. Ask user for PIN
   5. Call verifyPIN() to check if PIN is correct
   6. If PIN is wrong, show error and return
   7. Ask user for amount to withdraw
   8. Check if amount is valid and balance is sufficient
   9. If yes, subtract amount from balance[index]
   10. Display remaining balance

6. checkBalance()
   ---------------
   Purpose: Displays account information and balance
   
   Flow:
   1. Ask user for account number
   2. Call findAccount() to locate the account
   3. If account not found, show error and return
   4. Ask user for PIN
   5. Call verifyPIN() to check if PIN is correct
   6. If PIN is wrong, show error and return
   7. Display account number, name, and current balance

========================================
MAIN FUNCTION FLOW
========================================

1. Program starts at main()
2. Declare variable 'choice' to store user's menu selection
3. Enter infinite loop (while(1))
4. Display menu with 5 options
5. Ask user to enter choice (1-5)
6. Use switch statement to handle user's choice:
   
   Case 1: Call createaccount()
   Case 2: Call deposit()
   Case 3: Call withdraw()
   Case 4: Call checkBalance()
   Case 5: Display exit message and return 0 (end program)
   Default: Show error for invalid choice

7. After each function completes, loop continues and menu is shown again
8. Program only exits when user chooses option 5

========================================
PROGRAM EXECUTION FLOW EXAMPLE
========================================

Step 1: Program starts
       -> main() function executes
       -> Menu is displayed

Step 2: User selects option 1 (Create Account)
       -> createaccount() is called
       -> User enters account details
       -> Account is stored in arrays
       -> accountCount becomes 1
       -> Returns to menu

Step 3: User selects option 2 (Deposit)
       -> deposit() is called
       -> User enters account number
       -> findAccount() searches for account
       -> If found, user enters amount
       -> Balance is updated
       -> Returns to menu

Step 4: User selects option 3 (Withdraw)
       -> withdraw() is called
       -> User enters account number
       -> findAccount() searches for account
       -> User enters PIN
       -> verifyPIN() checks PIN
       -> If correct, user enters amount
       -> Balance is checked and updated
       -> Returns to menu

Step 5: User selects option 4 (Check Balance)
       -> checkBalance() is called
       -> User enters account number
       -> findAccount() searches for account
       -> User enters PIN
       -> verifyPIN() checks PIN
       -> If correct, balance is displayed
       -> Returns to menu

Step 6: User selects option 5 (Exit)
       -> Exit message is displayed
       -> return 0 executes
       -> Program ends

========================================
KEY CONCEPTS USED
========================================

1. Arrays: Store multiple accounts' data
2. Functions: Organize code into reusable blocks
3. Loops: while(1) for continuous menu, for loop for searching
4. Switch Statement: Handle different menu choices
5. Global Variables: Share data across functions
6. Return Values: Functions return -1 for not found, index for found
7. Input/Output: scanf() for input, printf() for output

========================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
========================================

- Maximum 8 accounts can be created
- Account data is stored in memory (lost when program closes)
- PIN verification is required for withdraw and check balance
- No file storage - data doesn't persist after program ends
- Simple validation is done (positive amounts, sufficient balance)
